# Chapter-1: A Normal Birth

Human beings come with a destiny into this beautiful world. Depending on the country, religion and the times in which we are born, the experiences we go through differ. Everyone is unique. No two things or no two persons are similar, cannot be similar. Some lives are event-less. Some are beds of roses. Some are full of struggles. A small incident may completely change the course of our life. Though these things are predestined, our approach towards such happenings can always be positive.

I was born and brought up in Karur and enjoyed a good childhood, just like most children in orthodox Indian families. Until marriage everything was as quiet as a calm sea, but little did we know that this was the calm before the storm. My husband Thiagu and I were made for each other and were on top of the world. The first few years of our life were spent in Bangalore. We were expecting our first child in a couple of months. Raghavun was born on one fine Deepavali day. Now, I am going to tell you a story of thirty two years.

Our life can be classified as before and after Raghavun’s birth. In world history, Jesus Christ's birth has such a great significance and the same is true with Raghavun's birth in our lives. Things changed. Can I say, changed for the better? Day 1…..Raghavun was born normal. Everything seemed normal. But, his inability to suck milk was one of the first signs of abnormality. We helplessly tried all possible means to make him suck milk. Finally, we had to feed him with an ink filler. That was not a cause for concern, or that is what our doctor said. Besides he was well fed, and slept peacefully most of the time for the first three days, just as any newborn would do. I didn't expect in my wildest dreams that many sleepless nights were going to follow.

As is the tradition in all Indian families, I came back to my parents' place with Raghavun after spending merely three days in the hospital. The baby was awake at night and slept during daytime. That too was not a cause for concern because many babies follow that pattern. The older women in my family assured me that it was quite normal. I was pampered in my parents home and I ate well, as I was a feeding mother, slept well and my mother took care of the baby throughout. In life, we don't know what God has in store for us. Maybe for the first few months, God was preparing me to run for the next many years, the warm-up and preparation before the marathon.

Days passed. The first seed of worry was sown in me after two months when Raghavun kept crying incessantly whenever he was awake. I couldn't discuss my fears with my husband as he was away from us because of work pressures and we were yet to join him. When we are surrounded by people close to us, worries take a back seat. Raghavun was still an infant and I was hopeful that better days would follow. Four months passed like this and it was time I joined my husband in Bangalore.

During the entire period of the four months that I was with my parents, Raghavun didn’t show any special preference to me. On joining his father, he spontaneously got attached or attracted to him. He was always with his dad whenever he was at home and cried when Thiagu left for work. At first I wasn't too bothered by this behaviour. But as the days went by, it was becoming increasingly difficult to handle him. His sleep habits were still nocturnal. He didn’t sleep at all at night. We took turns and kept awake. Obviously I allowed my husband to sleep a little longer as he had to go to the office and I was a homemaker and stayed home. Though Raghavun slept during the day, we had to finish all chores before he woke up. 

Fortunately, by this time he had learnt to suck milk. He slept alone in bed. He didn’t expect me to put him to sleep. Even if he woke up, he would be lying quietly without searching for me. We had a joola at home and at nights he would sit on the joola and would want us to rock it. He loved that rocking movement. It calmed him. He would cry his heart out and get tired and sleep on the joola itself. Those days we never slept in bed. We would sleep near the joola holding its strings in one hand and wake up with a shudder when Raghavun woke up from his short fifteen minutes nap at night. Gradually this difficult and different routine started having an impact on our health and moods. 

At this point I would like to pause and tell young parents something. Never allow anything to come between husband and wife. Only if you stay united can you win the battle. Don’t start the blame game. When things go wrong, it is easier to find fault with others. We always have a pitiable tendency to think that others are responsible for our problems or misfortunes. This is not so. Moreover, solving the problem we are facing at the present moment is more important than analysing who or what is the root cause of the problem. Though that’s also necessary, the immediate thing we have to do is to strike a balance, get back to normal health, keep the mind a little more calm so that we can think of the next course of action.
